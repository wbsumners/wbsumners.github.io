The Triplet Condition and Applications to Martensitic Phase Transformations
: We undertake a thorough investigation of the _triplet condition_, which is a compatibility condition on pairwise rank-one connections between three martensitic variants allowing for microstructures more complex than laminates of two variants. This condition was first studied by the group and collaborators of Tomonari Inamura in [1], where a direct relation between a triplet condition and the cofactor conditions was shown, implying a high degree of compatibility between the three variants. In this work, firstly, we precisely formulate a dichotomy between two types of triplet, and prove necessary and sufficient conditions on the rank-one connections for the triplet condition to be satisfied. Secondly, we study how the satisfaction of a triplet condition may provide for greater compatibility between martensite and austenite and in particular allow curved interfaces. We determine the set of volume fractions for the involved martensitic variants which allow an interface between austenite and martensite, showing that it is generically 1-dimensional (in contrast with the generically 0-dimensional set of admissible volume fractions for a classical austenite-martensite interface [2]). We apply our results to the case of cubic to (mixed-axis) orthorhombic wells.

Applications of Evolutionary Variational Inequalities to 1D Viscoelasticity 
: Joint with [Alexander Mielke](https://www.wias-berlin.de/people/mielke/?lang=1)
: We consider a Dirichlet problem in one-dimensional quasistatic nonlinear viscoelasticity of strain-rate type, with the elastic energy assumed to be non-convex in general. We generalize the theory of [1], developing in particular a well-posedness theory relying on spatial approximation by simple functions which exploits an ordering property and pointwise bounds independent of the initial data. Inspired by [2], we derive a condition under which solutions to the PDE are evolutionary variational inequality solutions to a gradient flow on a metric space, where the metric is related to the viscosity. However, unlike [2], our well-posedness theory is independent of a minimizing movements scheme, and in particular for the existence theory, initial data can be chosen from a class of functions larger than would be expected for a gradient flow.

Torsion of Helicoidal Möbius Bands
: This research was undertaken while an intern at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)
: A _helicoidal Möbius band_ is a nonorientable ruled surface which is the image of a helicoid which has been isometrically deformed so as to glue together its two ends. Such surfaces were studied in [1], where the minimal number of twists in a helicoid which can be deformed into a helicoidal Möbius band was determined. We investigate the class of helicoidal Möbius bands, attempting to determine this minimal number analytically. Also in [1], the midline of a helicoidal Möbius band was seen to be a spatial curve of constant torsion, with the torsion directly related to the number of twists of the underlying helicoid, therefore reducing the problem to a study of a certain class of curves of constant torsion. By studying the curves in [2], we determine a subclass for which this torsion can be computed explicitly, and show the minimum value, \\(\tau_E\\), is remarkably close to  the numerically determined minimal torsion \\(\tau_N\\) of [1]. However, we show that if the class of helicoidal Möbius bands is sufficiently rich, then \\(\tau_N < \tau_E\\).
