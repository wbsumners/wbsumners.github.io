The Triplet Condition and Applications to Martensitic Phase Transformations
: We undertake a thorough investigation of the _triplet condition_, which is a compatibility condition on pairwise rank-one connections between three martensitic variants allowing for microstructures more complex than laminates of two variants. Firstly, we precisely formulate a dichotomy between two types of triplet, and prove necessary and sufficient conditions on the rank-one connections for the triplet condition to be satisfied. Secondly, we study how the satisfaction of a triplet condition may provide for greater compatibility between martensite and austenite and in particular allow curved interfaces. For one side of the dichotomy, we determine the set of volume fractions for the involved martensitic variants which allow an interface between austenite and martensite with a tuple of volume fractions in this set. We apply our results to the case of cubic to (mixed-axis) orthorhombic wells.

Applications of Evolutionary Variational Inequalities to 1D Viscoelasticity 
: Joint with [Alexander Mielke](https://www.wias-berlin.de/people/mielke/?lang=1)
: We consider a Dirichlet problem in one-dimensional quasistatic nonlinear viscoelasticity of strain-rate type, with the elastic energy assumed to be non-convex in general. We develop a well-posedness theory relying on spatial approximation by simple functions, exploiting an ordering property and universal pointwise bounds. We derive a condition under which solutions to the PDE are evolutionary variational inequality solutions to a gradient flow on a metric space, where the metric is related to the viscosity.

Torsion of Helicoidal Möbius Bands
: This research was undertaken while an intern at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)
: A _helicoidal Möbius band_ is a nonorientable ruled surface which is the image of a helicoid which has been isometrically deformed so as to glue together its two ends. The midline of a helicoidal Möbius band can be seen to to be a spatial curve of constant torsion. We investigate the class of helicoidal Möbius bands, attempting to determine the minimal torsion of the midline among each element of this class. We determine a subclass for which the torsion can be computed explicitly, and show the minimum value, \\(\tau_E\\) is remarkably close to a numerically determined minimal torsion \\(\tau_N\\). However, we show that if the class of helicoidal Möbius bands is sufficiently rich, then \\(\tau_N < \tau_E\\).
