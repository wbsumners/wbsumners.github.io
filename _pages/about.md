I am a PhD student in mathematical analysis, under the [MAC-MIGS CDT programme](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/) run by the Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences of the University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University. My supervisor is [John Ball](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/ball/).

My research interests are calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and geometry broadly. In particular, I'm interested in problems informed by the microstructure of complex materials, such as materials which exhibit martensitic phase transformations (e.g. shape-memory alloys).
